* ArmSim Overview *
*******************
The goal of this program is to simulate an arm64 processor
executing a compiled .s file. It attempts to be compatible
with the format of gnu assembler files and supports a subset
of the instructions and directives. The basic operation of
the simulator is that it first reads in a .s file line by 
line and separates the input into code and symbol declarations. 
The data in static memory is simulated with a python list, where
each element represents one byte as an int. It attempts to execute 
each line of code by matching against regular expressions that encode 
the instruction format, and updating global variables appropriately 
based on that execution. All text is converted to lower case, 
meaning that identifiers are not case sensitive 
(so variable = VARIABLE).
Currently supported:
  System Calls:
    read      0x3f  (63) --stdin only
    write     0x40  (64) --stdout only
    getrandom 0x116 (278)
  Labels:
    Can be any text (current no numbers) prepended with
    any number of periods or underscores and should end in 
    a colon. The same label cannot be declared twice. Since 
    text is converted to lowercase, LABEL: and label: would 
    count as the same. Labels must be declared on their OWN 
    line.
  Directives:
    .data    (declare a region of initialized data)
        .asciz   (declare a string in the .data section)
        .8byte   (declare an array of 8 bytes words in the .data section)
        =        (assignment of a variable to a constant value within the .data section)
        = . -      (find the length of the previously declared item within the .data section)
    .bss     (declare a region of unitialized data)
        .space   (declare an empty buffer in the .bss section)

  Instructions:
    **{s} means that 's' can be optionally added to the end of an
    instruction to make the result affect the flags**
    rd = destination register
    rn = first register operand
    rm = second register operand

    x[1-2]\d
        matches registers x10 - x29 (fp is used instead of x29, should fix this)

        negative lookahead to ensure that cases like x222 aren't matched
    (?<!0)x\d(?!\w)
        same explanations as above, but this is for registers x0 - x9

A map of string to int, where int will either be
an index into the mem array or a size in bytes.
Basically, vars declared with a : will be addresses and
vars declared with = will be literals
Additionally the directive type will be stored in the following way:
-an key in the form <var>_TYPE_ will map to
0 -> asciz
1 -> 8byte
2 -> space
NB. vars declared with = (ie length variables) are just stored in
sym_table as numbers, so they don't have a type
Types are stored primarily for the get_data procedure
'''
sym_table = {}
'''
Data is stored as a list. Each element is an int that represents a byte. 
String data gets "converted" by doing list(bytes(str,'ascii')) and numbers 
get converted into a list from their byte representation using list(int.tobytes()).
It is accessed with an index and a size using the format [addr:addr+size].
The stack pointer also points to the end of this list and grows down.
It's first filled with static data, then the heap is appended, followed
by the stack
The sp (stack pointer) register will point to the end of the list 
and the heap pointer will point to the end of the static section to start
Thus, we get the following diagram

| static | heap | stack |
